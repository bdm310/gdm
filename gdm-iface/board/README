WIP project of multi interface board. This board contains:

connector for 400/500/4000 stations
external serial connector
level translators 3v to 5v
dcdc converter for powering mcu
radio
max232
stm32 bluepill
-12V dc dc (optional, for angular board interfacing)


Aim of this board is:

- interface for programming of 400/500/4000 stations with serial communication - this is working!
- radio interface for gdm600 station - not implemented in firmware
- radio interface for computer - counterpart to upper radio - not implemented
- direct interface to gdm boards - angle/servo - needs firmware modification
- 4x servo output - used for 400station calibration - working, needs better software for calibration calculation.




Notes on build:

-when mounting dc dc converter board be sure to use diode as one "leg" (on output "+" signal). This will prevent 5v going from usb to dcdc converter
-be sure to use genuine STM32 bluepill - some bluepills use different mcu that contains different USB peripheral - not working with our firmware.
-set dc dc to 5.0volts (+diode forward voltage) before plugging in bluepill and level translators. This will prevent from frying them.
