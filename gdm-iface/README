GDM-If - geodimeter 400/500/4000 interface tool
-----------------------------------------------

This directory contains sources for stm32 bluepill board. There
are 3 projects:

- gdm-iface - interface to communicate with 400/500/4400 series
              geodimeter stations

- gdm-iface-arduino - version of gdm-iface for Arduino. This is
              hacky, isn't reusing libraries from gdm-iface, and
              doesn't have the full feature set yet.
              Use gdm-iface if you can.

- gdm-fakeedm - fake edm for 400/500 station - my broke during
              R&D and this was replacement. It was tested
              with 400 station. Returns fake 1234.000m distance

- gdm-edmemul - take on edm mcu emulation using bluepull, never
                actually tested as stm32 is 3v3volt and original
                mcu is 5v.

- serial-sniffer - firmware that uses 2 separate serial port RX
                   outputs data on USB serial port. Useful for
                   rs232 traffic sniffing.

Windows driver:
-----------------
Most recent version needs inf driver under windows as Iface presents itself as 2 serial ports:
one is for interface itself
one is for communication with station

Both are named as such in windows, so you can easily recognize which is which.


using built binary:
-----------------
Directory "binary" contains the latest binary firmware, so you don't need to compile it yourself.

building sources:
-----------------
download recent gnuarm toolchain, install, put into PATH.

in fw directory type:

make

firmware will be in FLASH_RUN/ directory.

use openocd to flash, scripts are provided.

If you want to build bin. Type:

make bin

bin will be in the same output directory.

interface how to (new version):
-----------------
there is board design in the "board" directory. It contains eagle files and gerbers to mfg custom board.

For this board you will need:
1-2x level translators (transistor type)
1x bluepill with original stm32f103
1x dcdc converter
1-2x db9 female angle connector
some pinheaders + jumpers
dc barrel connector


interface how to (old version):
-----------------

for interface you need:
1x bluepill - original stm32f103 based! not chinese clone
1x transistor level translator - do not use bidir TXSxxxx these will self-oscillate on longer wires 
1x 10uF capacitor (>6.3V)
1x DB9 connector
cables

5V and 3v3 from bluepill to translator board
10uF capacitor on 5V side of translator board

pin PB12 (IO1) to level translator channel x VCCa side
pin PB13 (IO2) to level translator channel y VCCa side
pin PB14 (IO3) to level translator channel z VCCa side

DB9 pin 7  to IO1 VCCb side
DB9 pin 1  to IO2 VCCb side
DB9 pin 5  to IO3 VCCb side
DB9 pin 4  gnd
DB9 pin 6  power +
DB9 pin 9  power -

GDM Internal Bus Description
The GDM internal communication bus consists of three lines: GDM_DAT, GDM_ACK, and GDM_CLK. These lines are all open drain, pulled high by the design of the microcontrollers.

Communication is done with packets of the following structure:
1 byte Command
1 byte Length
Length bytes Data
3 bit Ack sequence after every Data byte

To send a bit, the sender sets GDM_DAT to the bit value and then pulls GDM_CLK low to notify the receiver of available data. When the receiver latches this bit, it pulls GDM_ACK low to notify the sender that the bit has been read. The sender then brings GDM_CLK and GDM_DAT back to idle (high). The sender waits for the receiver to bring GDM_ACK idle (high) again before sending any additional bits.

To send a byte, the above is done sequentially.
